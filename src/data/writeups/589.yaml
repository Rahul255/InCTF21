  The challenge description says: I made a curl as a service. what could go wrong Also the flag is in flag.php
  Curl is a tool that can be used to make http requests.

  Learn more about Curl [here](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/what-is-curl-command/).

  SSRF can be expanded as Server-Side Request Forgery. So what does this mean? We know what each of the words
  individually means - Server-Side=> Backend, Request => A message that is being sent to a server,
  Forgery => A false entity. When we put all this together, we can understand that SSRF is a bug that enables an
  attacker to allow make requests from the backend to a different server. The next question is why would someone wanna
  make requests from the backend? Can't they directly do it from their devices? The reason for this is that the
  server may use some internal APIs that can be accessed only locally or have IP whitelisting. When we make the
  request from the backend, the source IP for that would be of the IP of the backend server even though it was
  the us who initiated it. Expanding more on internal IPs, they are a huge part of the current web architectures.

  With the introduction of Microservices Based Architecture (https://microservices.io/), internal services are huge now.
  Some of the most common internal IPs are http://127.0.0.1 and http://localhost/.

  Coming back to the challenge, the page says "Give me a URL and I will curl it for you.". By "Give me a URL",
  it means to send a URL as a GET parameter. We are also told that the flag is in /flag.php, but when we visit
  that directly, the page says "Not allowed from ip:192.168.53.169". So, we can assume that we need to be from
  a particular IP to access it. We can try accessing it using http://127.0.01/. Now we can add the flag path
  to this URL and try using this as the URL parameter.
