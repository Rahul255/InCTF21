  The page has a login form.
  Since the title says "Client Auth", we can assume that the authentication part happens on the client-side.
  So, we need to check the source to know what's happening.
  There is a `/script.js` file being used.
  From this file, we can see that the username and password are being compared to a value and once that is correct
  we are taken to the path `<the-correct-password>/<the-correct-username>.html`

  The username and password are compared to a value using a function called `String.fromCodePoint()`.

  This function is used to convert values into a string. That is, `String.fromCodePoint(97)` will return "a".

  Now that we know how the authentication is being done, we can directly check what username and password the
  code is expecting.

  ```
  us == String.fromCodePoint(0x61,0x64,0x6D,0x69,0x6E,0x33,0x32,0x31) && pp == String.fromCharCode(105,95,97,109,95,99,48,48,76,95,95)
  ```

  We can get the values using the "Console" tab of "DevTools".

  You can access this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I` or `F12`.

  Then paste `String.fromCodePoint(0x61,0x64,0x6D,0x69,0x6E,0x33,0x32,0x31)` and hit enter.

  Do the same for pp comparison and you'll get the password.

  After this, you'll get `admin321` and <HIDDEN> and username and password respectively.

  When we use this to log in, we are taken to a page that says "Debug".

  This means the Console tab of DevTools.

  If we access the console, we can get the flag.
