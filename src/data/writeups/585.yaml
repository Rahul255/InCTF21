  The challenge opens up a blank page that says "ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?". Even the source has nothing in it.
  The next thing we can do is to check the headers sent for this page. To do that, open DevTools
  (press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) and go to the Network tab. If that has nothing, refresh the page again and
  you'll see all the requests made from this page.

  Click on the request and go to the Headers tab. We can see that one of the headers is "Hint: only oreo lovers here!".
  And two cookies are being set - time and favcookie. Using the hint(and knowledge that oreo is sort of a cookie),
  we can assume that the value for favcookie needs to be oreo. Again we can use the DevTools to change cookie value.

  Go to the Application tab of DevTools and click on the domain name under the Cookies part of Storage.
  We can see the two cookies in here. Now, double click on xxx to enter Edit mode and type in oreo there.
  For the effects to take place, reload the page. Now, we can see another sentence on the page saying
  "Yummy ! I will give you the flag when it is 20:30 :)". Now, using the same way, we can change the value
  for the time cookie to 20:30. Once we reload the page, we can see the flag.
