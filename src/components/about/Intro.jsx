                                cyber security while cyber attacks and breaches are rapidly increasing world-wide. In order to
                                encourage the youth to participate, they need to be taught at a young age about the importance of
                                computer security.

                                participants to develop real world security skills. Many of the countries like USA and China have
                                realized the need for cyber security education and are conducting CTF contests for school students.
